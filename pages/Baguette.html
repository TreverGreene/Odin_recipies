    <h1>Baguette</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is mostly taken from king arthur flour's wonderful <a href=https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-baguettes-recipe>baguette recipe</a>, but also incorporates elements from <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29737861-bread-illustrated>America's Test Kitchen: Bread Illustrated</a>. 
        The Baguettes come out crispy on the outside and wonderfully soft on the inside, a treat on their own or, in my ideal, with a soft cheese.</p>
    <h4>Time to completion: 36 hours</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 and 1/2 Cups Bread Flour</li>
        <li>1 and 9/16ths teaspoons Dry Active Yeast</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 Cups Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>The Day Before: Starter or Poolish</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Establish a feeder culture with 1/2 cup water, a pinch of yeast (1/16th teaspoon) and a cup of flour, let rest at room temperature overnight</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Dough Preparation and Baking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Mix together starter flour water and the rest of the yeast. This will form a rough dough. Work the dough by hand or in a mixer until it is soft and mostly smooth. It will look something like this</li>

        <li>Place the dough in a slightly greased medium-sized bowl, cover, and let rest for 45 minutes. </li>

        <li>The risen dough should be deflated by pressing your fist into the center of the mass, fold the edges over, then turn over the ball in the bowl before letting it rise another 45 minutes.</li>

        <li>Divide the dough into 3 equally sized balls (you can use a scale if you want to be precise), form into a baguette shape. This is hard to describe, so I will say watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRDL3lPQSkc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video </a></li>
